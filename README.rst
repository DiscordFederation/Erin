    <h4>What is Erin?</h4>
        <p>Erin is an initiative to build a bot development framework like how Django is a framework for web applications. It is built on top of the <a href="https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py/tree/rewrite">discord.py</a> library and supports all of it's extensions by default.</p>

    <h4>What are Erin's goals?</h4>
       <p> As part of the initiative, we have set sights on a few milestones we want to achieve and will release the first pre-alpha once these goals have been met.
       <ul>
           <li>Ease of use.</li>
           <li>Support for SQL databases.</li>
           <li>Full localization support.</li>
           <li>Complete customizability.</li>
       </ul>

    <h4>Can I get started with Erin today?</h4>
       <p>Yes, Erin works out of the box with all <a href="https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py/tree/rewrite">discord.py</a> <a href="https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/rewrite/ext/commands/api.html#discord.ext.commands.Bot.load_extension">extensions</a>. You can read how to set it up in the <a href="https://erin.rtfd.io">documentation</a>. However, keep in mind that this project has not even released a pre-alpha yet. This is because we are still deliberating core architecture and we want to get it right the first time. As a result expect plenty of changes to the API without any notice at all.</p>
