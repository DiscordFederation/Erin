-----------------------------------------------

What is Erin?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Erin is an initiative to build a bot development framework like how
flask is a framework for web applications. It is built on top of the
`discord.py`_ library and supports all of it's extensions by default.

What are Erin's goals?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As part of the initiative, we have set sights on a few milestones we
want to achieve and will release the first pre-alpha once these goals
have been met.

-  Ease of use.
-  Web Dashboard.
-  Full localization support.
-  Complete customizability.

Can I get started with Erin today?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Yes, Erin works out of the box with all `discord.py`_ `extensions`_. You
can read how to set it up in the `documentation`_. However, keep in mind
that this project has not even released a pre-alpha yet. This is because
we are still deliberating core architecture and we want to get it right
the first time. As a result expect plenty of changes to the API without
any notice at all.
